=========

Here we tried to implement typical examples of software for sensor networks and show how ConesC can help to improve the development process there. Each folder in project is a scenraio. In each scenario we implemented two versions of firmware: using plain nesC and ConesC. To get more on ConesC and how to use it, please, refer to our prallel [ConesC project](https://github.com/muxanasov/ConesC).
